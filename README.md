## 💡 About Me

I'm a results-driven **Frontend Developer** with **4+ years of experience** building rich, user-focused applications using modern JavaScript frameworks. I specialize in **React.js**, **TypeScript**, and **component-driven architecture**, and I have a passion for writing clean, maintainable code that scales with teams and products.

I thrive in fast-paced, Agile environments, and enjoy solving complex UI challenges by combining user-centric thinking with technical best practices.
